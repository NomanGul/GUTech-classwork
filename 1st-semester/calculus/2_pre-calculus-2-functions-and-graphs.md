# Functions

### Linear Function

A linear function is a function that can be represented by a straight line. When the function is plotted on a graph, it forms a straight line. When x increases, y increases or decreases at a constant rate.

### Exponential Function

An exponential function is a function that can be represented by a curve. When the function is plotted on a graph, it forms a curve. When x increases, y increases a lot.

y = mx + b

m is the slope of the line.
b is the y-intercept of the line.

when m > 0, the line is increasing.
when m < 0, the line is decreasing.
when m = 0, the line is horizontal.
when m = undefined, the line is vertical.

# Graphs

### Intercepts of Graphs

The x-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the x-axis. The y-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis.
