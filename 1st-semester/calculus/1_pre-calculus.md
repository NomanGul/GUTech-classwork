# Numbers

Integars: ..., -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... (whole numbers - positive and negative)

Rational Numbers: 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, ... (can be written as a fraction)

Irrational Numbers: π, e, √2, ... (cannot be written as a fraction)

Real Numbers: Integars, Rational Numbers, Irrational Numbers

Even Numbers: ..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ... (divisible by 2)

Odd Numbers: ..., -3, -1, 1, 3, ... (not divisible by 2)

Prime Numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ... (only divisible by 1 and itself)

1. N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...} (natural numbers)
2. Z = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...} (integers)
3. Q = {p/q | p, q ∈ Z, q ≠ 0} (rational numbers)
4. R = {x | x is a real number} (real numbers)


# Sets

A set is a collection of elements.

The elements in a set are called elements.

The elements in a set are enclosed in curly braces {}.

The elements in a set are unique.
for example:
{a, a, b} are not sets.
{a, b, c} are sets.

The elements in a set are not ordered.
for example:
{a, b, c} === {b, a, c}

### Symbols

- ∈: element of
- ∉: not an element of
- ⊂: proper subset
- ⊄: not a proper subset
- ⊆: subset or equal to
- ⊇: superset or equal to
- ∪: union
- ∩: intersection
- ∅: empty set
- ∀: for all
- ∃: there exists
- ∄: there does not exist
- ∈: element of
- ∉: not an element of
- |: such that
- ∴: therefore
- ∵: because

### Subsets / Improper Subset

A subset is a set that is contained in another set.

for example:
{a, b, c} ⊆ {a, b, c}

### Union

The union of two sets is the set of all elements that are in either set.

for example:
{a, b} ∪ {b, c} = {a, b, c}

### Intersection

The intersection of two sets is the set of all elements that are in both sets.

for example:
{a, b} ∩ {b, c} = {b}

### Proper Subset

A proper subset is a subset that is not equal to the set itself.

for example:
{a, b} ⊂ {a, b, c}

### Cross Product / Cartesian Product

The cross/cartesian product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs of elements from the two sets.

for example:
{a, b} × {c, d} = {(a, c), (a, d), (b, c), (b, d)}

Real life example:
{Noman, Ali, Ahmed} × {Math, Physics, Chemistry} = {(Noman, Math), (Noman, Physics), (Noman, Chemistry), (Ali, Math), (Ali, Physics), (Ali, Chemistry), (Ahmed, Math), (Ahmed, Physics), (Ahmed, Chemistry)}

# Functions

A function is a relation that assigns to each element of a set a unique element of another set.

for example:
f(x) = x^2

f(x) = x^2 is a function because for each element of x, there is a unique element of y.

for 1 input, there is only 1 output.

for example:
f(1) = 1^2 = 1
f(2) = 2^2 = 4

but 1 output can map to multiple inputs.

for example:
f(1) = 1^2 = 1
f(-1) = (-1)^2 = 1

### Domain

The domain of a function is the set of all possible inputs of the function.

for example:
f(x) = x^2

the domain of f(x) is all real numbers.

### Codomain

The codomain of a function is the set of all possible outputs of the function.

for example:
f(x) = x^2

the codomain of f(x) is all real numbers.

### Range

The range of a function is the set of all possible outputs of the function.

for example:
f(x) = x^2

the range of f(x) is all non-negative real numbers.

delta symbol: ∆

### Function example

if f(x) = x^2 - 2x
and x = 2

1. f(x + ∆x) = (x + ∆x)^2 - 2(x + ∆x) = x^2 + 2x∆x + ∆x^2 - 2x - 2∆x
2. (f(x + ∆x) - f(x)) / ∆x = ((x^2 + 2x∆x + ∆x^2 - 2x - 2∆x) - (x^2 - 2x)) / ∆x

### Injective Function / 1-1 Function

A function is injective if each element of the codomain is mapped to by exactly one element of the domain.

for example:
every person has unique fingerprint
every car has unique number plate
every phone has unique IMEI
etc.

### Surjective Function / Onto Function

Range = Codomain

every output must map to an input.

### Bijective Function

A function is bijective if it is both injective and surjective.
