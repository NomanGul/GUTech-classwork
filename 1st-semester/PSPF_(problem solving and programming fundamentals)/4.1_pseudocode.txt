Lab tasks

Lab Task 1: Coffee Shop Bill Calculator
Write an algorithm to calculate the total bill at a coffee shop. The user should input the price of
an item and the quantity they want to purchase. The algorithm should compute the subtotal, add
8% tax, and display the final total.

START
  INPUT item_price, quantity
  subtotal = item_price * quantity
  total = (subtotal * 0.8) + subtotal
  OUTPUT total
END

Lab Task 2: Weekly Water Intake Tracker
Design an algorithm to help a person track their weekly water intake. The program should ask
the user to input their daily water intake (in liters) for 7 days, calculate the total intake, and
determine whether the person met their weekly goal of 14 liters.

START
  FOR i FROM 1 TO 7
    INPUT daily_water_intake_liters
    total_water_intake = total_water_intake + daily_water_intake_liters
  ENDFOR
  IF total_water_intake >= 14 THEN
    OUTPUT "good work"
  ELSE
    OUTPUT "not enough"
  ENDIF
END

Lab Task 3: Movie Ticket Price with Discount
Create an algorithm to calculate the total price of movie tickets. The user should input the
number of tickets and whether they are a student. If the user is a student, they should receive a
15% discount.

START
  INPUT ticket_price, number_of_tickets, is_student
  total_price = ticket_price * number_of_tickets
  IF is_student THEN
    total_price = total_price * 0.85
  ENDIF
  OUTPUT total_price
END

Lab Task 4: Mobile Data Usage Warning
Write an algorithm that takes the user’s mobile data limit and the amount of data they’ve used.
The program should warn the user if less than 10% of their data is remaining.

START
  INPUT data_used, amount_of_data
  IF data_used < (amount_of_data * 0.1) THEN
    OUTPUT "warning"
  ENDIF
END

Lab Task 5: Bus Fare Calculator Based on Age
Design an algorithm to determine a person's bus fare based on their age. Use the following
conditions:
● Children under 5 ride free.
● Students (ages 5–18) pay 5 units.
● Adults (ages 19–60) pay 10 units.
● Seniors (over 60) pay 6 units.

START
  INPUT age
  IF age < 5 THEN
    OUTPUT "free"
  ELSE IF age <= 18 THEN
    OUTPUT "5 units"
  ELSE IF age <= 60 THEN
    OUTPUT "10 units"
  ELSE
    OUTPUT "6 units"
  ENDIF
END

Lab Task 6: Daily Step Tracker
Create an algorithm to calculate the total number of steps a person walks in a week. The user
should input their daily steps for 7 days. The algorithm should also calculate the average
number of steps per day.

START
  days = 7
  total_steps = 0
  FOR i FROM 1 TO days
    INPUT daily_steps
    total_steps = total_steps + daily_steps
  ENDFOR
  average_steps = total_steps / days
  OUTPUT total_steps, average_steps
END

Lab Task 7: Rain Forecast Alert
Write an algorithm that checks the weather forecast for the next 5 days. The user should input
whether it is expected to rain or not each day. If rain is expected on any day, the program should
display a message advising the user to carry an umbrella.

START
  days = 5
  FOR i FROM 1 TO days
    INPUT expected_rain
    IF expected_rain THEN
      OUTPUT "carry an umbrella"
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR
END

Lab Task 8: Parking Fee Calculator
Design an algorithm to calculate the parking fee based on the number of hours a car is parked.
The first 2 hours cost 5 units. Every additional hour costs 2 units each.

START
  INPUT car_parking_hours
  IF car_parking_hours <= 2 THEN
    OUTPUT 5
  ELSE
    OUTPUT 5 + (car_parking_hours - 2) * 2
  ENDIF
END

Lab Task 9: Delivery Tip Calculator
Write an algorithm to suggest a tip amount based on a customer's service rating. The user
should input the bill amount and rate the service from 1 to 5:
● Rating 4 or 5: tip = 20% of bill
● Rating 3: tip = 10% of bill
● Rating 1 or 2: no tip

START
  INPUT bill_amount, service_rating
  IF service_rating >= 4 THEN
    OUTPUT bill_amount * 0.2
  ELSE IF service_rating = 3 THEN
    OUTPUT bill_amount * 0.1
  ELSE
    OUTPUT 0
  ENDIF
END

Lab Task 10: Eco Points Tracker for Recycling
Create an algorithm to calculate eco points based on the number of items a user recycles:
● Less than 10 items: 1 point per item
● Between 10 and 20 items: 2 points per item
● More than 20 items: 3 points per item

START
  INPUT number_of_recycling_items
  IF number_of_recycling_items < 10 THEN
    OUTPUT number_of_recycling_items
  ELSE IF number_of_recycling_items <= 20 THEN
    OUTPUT number_of_recycling_items * 2
  ELSE
    OUTPUT number_of_recycling_items * 3
  ENDIF
END
